# Improving-Precision-Agriculture-by-utilizing-Resnet-152-for-Cassava-Plant-Disease-Detection
Improving crop health monitoring and cassava plant disease detection using ResNet-152 is a promising approach in modern agriculture. ResNet-152 is a deep-learning model known for its exceptional performance in image recognition tasks. By leveraging this powerful neural network, we can enhance the accuracy and efficiency .
The project mainly discusses about the detection of cassava plant disease . The main aim of this project is to develop an accurate and robust image classification model for identifying cassava  leaf diseases.
The goal is to create a system that can automatically analyze images of cassava leaves and classify them into different disease categories, including but not limited to cassava mossaic disease, cassava bacterial blight, and cassava brown streak disease.
The model should be capable of accurately distinguishing between healthy leaves and leaves affected by various diseases. 
This  solution aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts in early detection and proper mangement of cassava diseases, thereby improving crop yield, minimizing economic losses , and ensuring food security.
